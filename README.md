# ShareLoc.XYZ
An open platform for sharing single-molecule localization microscopy data and tools.

## Key Features
 * Open repository for single-molecule localization data and tools
 * Storing data on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)
 * Open and extendable via [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io) plugins
 * Browser-based SMLM data viewer with 2D/3D, no installation required
 * Easy-to-use upload interface with file preview support
 * Import various type of file formats

## The SMLM file format

To enable faster preview and portable sharing, we developed a binary and losslessly compressed file format for storing localization tables and image patches.
